Grapht is a light-weight dependency injector. It converts the dependency
injection problem into a graph-based problem that can be solved and analyzed
without constructing any components until a solution is guaranteed. The solution
graph is also exposed to enable flexible extensions such as static analysis, 
and visualizations.  Its design is discussed in our paper:

> Michael D. Ekstrand and Michael Ludwig. 2016. Dependency Injection with Static Analysis and Context-Aware Policy. <cite>Journal of Object Technology</cite> 15(1) (February 1st, 2016), 1:1â€“31. DOI [10.5381/jot.2016.15.1.a1](https://dx.doi.org/10.5381/jot.2016.15.1.a1).

Grapht also supports specifying dependency bindings based on where in the
graph the components must be injected. This allows a programmer to specify that
a type Foo must be used in the context of type A, but a Bar should be used in
any other context. This can be used to compliment the idea of qualifying
injection points using annotations, as specified in [JSR 330][jsr330].

Grapht provides a fluent configuration API very similar to that of 
[Guice's][guice].

## Release Notes

### 0.10.0

- Add `@AliasFor` to allow qualifiers to alias each other.

### 0.8.1

- Move `Types.getDefaultClassLoader()` to `ClassLoaders.inferDefault()`
- Add class loader context management

### 0.8.0

- Dependency graphs now use `Dependency` and `Component` types, instead of `DesireChain` and
  `CachedSatisfaction`, for greater forward flexibility.
- Support fixed desires (will not be rewritten)

### 0.7.0

See [closed issues][issues-0.7] for more details.

- Enable regular expression matching for contexts (#83)
- Allow binding to satisfactions
- Refactor the reflection abstractions, dropping the SPI in favor of the `reflect` package.
- Use an immutable DAG instead of the old mutable Graph
- Support rewriting graphs using bind rules
- Make more use of Guava
- Support custom/arbitrary class loaders (typically the thread's context class loader)

[issues-0.7]: https://github.com/grouplens/grapht/issues?milestone=10&state=closed

### 0.6.0

See [closed issues][issues-0.6] for more details.

* Added typed providers
* Add `DependencySolverBuilder` to make construction more obvious
* Make instance providers serializable

[issues-0.6]: https://bitbucket.org/grouplens/grapht/issues?status=duplicate&status=invalid&status=resolved&status=wontfix&milestone=0.6.0

### 0.5.0

See [closed issues][issues-0.5] for more details.

- Rewrite serialization logic to be more robust (#54)
- Return immutable views rather than copies of sets from `Graph` (#58)
- Be smarter about checking provider types (#35, #36)
- Add anchored context matchers (`at` matching) (#41)
- Improve diagnostic warnings and validity checking
- Rename `Edge.getLabel()` to `getDesireChain()`
- Change `Graph.updateEdgeLabel` to `replaceEdge`
- Remove `Binding.finalBinding` in favor of boolean parameter on `to` (#46)
- Add a visitor for satisfactions (#33)
- Add support for specifying default implementations and providers in properties files under the
  `META-INF` directory (#51)
- `Module.bind` is now called `Module.configure`
- **Incompatible change:** Changed default binding policy with respect to qualfier matching.  Now, if you bind a type without specifying any qualifier, it defaults to binding unqualified dependencies and dependencies whose qualifiers are annotated with `@AllowUnqualifiedMatch`.  To get the old behavior of matching irrespective of qualifier matcher, do `bind(Type.class).withAnyQualifier()` (or `bindAny(Type.class)`).

[issues-0.5]: https://bitbucket.org/grouplens/grapht/issues?status=duplicate&status=invalid&status=resolved&status=wontfix&milestone=0.5.0

### 0.4.3

* Fix serialization of inner classes

### 0.4.2

* Fix serialization of primitive types in graphs

### 0.4.1

* Add `DefaultNull` annotation and support for it.

### 0.4.0

See [closed issues][issues-0.4] for more details.

* Remove `Parameter` anotation
* Add basic thread safety for injectors
* Add more error detection
* Add convenience method to bind qualified types
* Allow explicit null bindings to be created

[issues-0.4]: https://bitbucket.org/grouplens/grapht/issues?status=duplicate&status=invalid&status=resolved&status=wontfix&milestone=0.4.0

### 0.3.0
* Refactor SPI and bind rules to allow for more flexible binding functions.
  This brings the implementation much closer to the theoretical formulation
  presented in our paper.

* Add support for generic attribute annotations on injection points that are
  carried through the solution graph.
* Add slf4j logging to grapht

### 0.1.0
* Initial published release of grapht
* Supports basic and context-aware dependency injection
