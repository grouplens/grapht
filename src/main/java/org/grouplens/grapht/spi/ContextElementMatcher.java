/**
 * <p>
 * ContextElementMatcher represents a "pattern" that can match an element within the
 * dependency context created as a Resolver follows a dependency hierarchy. The
 * dependency context is an ordered list of satisfactions and the qualifiers of the desires they satisfy.
 * The first satisfaction is the root satisfaction, a {@code null} satisfaction of type {@code void}.
 * <p>
 * ContextMatchers can match or apply to these nodes and {@link Qualifier}s
 * within a dependency context. As an example, the reflection based
 * ContextElementMatcher matches nodes that are sub-types of the type the matcher was
 * configured with.
 * <p>
 * ContextMatchers are composed into a list with {@link ElementChainContextMatcher} to
 * parallel the composing of nodes and {@link Qualifier}s into the dependency
 * context list. The ElementChainContextMatcher can then be used to determine if the list of
 * ContextMatchers applies to any given dependency context.
