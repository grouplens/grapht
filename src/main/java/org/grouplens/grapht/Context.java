/**

 * Context is the main entry point for configuring bind rules using the fluent
 * API. The dependency injector uses the contexts to limit the scope of a
 * binding. Every time a dependency is satisfied, that type (and possibly {@link Qualifier})
 * is pushed onto the context stack. Thus, if two different types each require a
 * Foo, there can be two different bindings activated depending on which first
 * type is in the context stack.
 * <p>
 * The "root" context is an empty stack, and will always be matched. When
 * creating bindings, the context stack can be configured by calling
 * {@link #in(Class)} or {@link #in(Class, Class)}.
