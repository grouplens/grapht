/**
 * <p>
 * DependencySolver is a utility for resolving Desires into a dependency graph,
 * where nodes are shared when permitted by a Satisfaction's dependency
 * configuration. It supports qualified and context-aware injection, and
 * just-in-time injection if the type has an injectable constructor.
 * <p>
 * The conceptual binding function used by this solver is represented as a list
 * of prioritized {@link BindingFunction functions}. Functions at the start of
 * the list are used first, which makes it easy to provide custom functions that
 * override default behaviors.
 * <p>
 * This solver does not support cyclic dependencies because of the possibility
 * that a context later on might activate a bind rule that breaks the cycle. To
 * ensure termination, it has a maximum context depth that is configurable.
