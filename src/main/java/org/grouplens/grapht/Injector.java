 * InjectorBuilder b = new InjectorBuilder();
 * b.bind(Foo.class).to(Bar.class);
 * b.applyModule(new MyCustomModule());
 * // other bindings
 * Injector i = b.build();
 * assert (i.getInstance(Foo.class) instanceof Bar);

 * <p>
 * Alternatively, {@link BindingFunctionBuilder}, and {@link InjectSPI}
 * can be used to create your own Injector implementations.
